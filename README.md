# News & Politics Web Scraper 

The purpose of this bit of code and program is to scrape infromation and news from news sources and media groups. Pyhon will take user input to find specific news articles and podcasts recently pubslihed about it. In this case it only works for Politics and the code gives the latest political newes article headlines and summaries and provides the user with a direct link to view the full article. 

## Description

This code and project was desined to serve a goal of making it easier and faster to consume news and specifically political content. Ultimetly this program will the users input which currently can only be "congress" or "white-house" to then find articles and news relating to those subjects. The infromation of were diffrent articles or podcasts are coming from but they are Politico, NPR, and Washington Post. With the help of the BeauftifulSoup module the code will pull the either top 2 or 1 articles and it'll give the user the headline, summary, and link to the sources. This proram is by no means supsosed to be used as a sinular resource and articles should be bread on their respective sites. This code and program just makes it easier for the user to know what's trending and going on and how to get to it! 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The following list of modules were used and would be needed to run the code:
* Termcolor
* Requests 
* BeauftifulSoup


### Installing
* There are no downloads, fies, folders that need to be downloaded. Here in Repl the code is ready to go and if you hit Run within main.py everything should work, no downloads required :D
### Executing program
To run the program:

1. When you first run and start the code it will prompt you for some input. With the way the code is in it's current state the only inputs that'll work and not end in an error are: "congress" and "white-house"
2. After entering and submistting your input the program will begin to work printing out a couple of Articles with headlines and summaries. The first two will be from Politco, the middle two will be from NPR, and the bottom one will be from Washington Post
3. After the time of giving your input wait at least 5 to 15 seconds for Washington Posts Articel Parsing takes a good coupple of seconds. It will look like the code is doing nothing but just wait it should print it. 
4. Look at the numbers that will look like this: "[1]" next to the Bodled Article Headlines. Read throught the summaries and headlines and find the article that intrests you the most.
5. Then after the last article is parsed and prints you the user will be prompted to give input on the article you wanted to read and see. Input just the corresponding number of the article in and the program will output a link to the article you wanted to see.
6. And That's All Folks!

* Step-by-step bullets


## Help

If issues are run into with the code the best suggestion is to re-run it making sure to double check your first intial inputs spelling and formating, and that you are inputing a valid article number on the second input. If isssues still arise after resarting the page you the contact bellow so I can check out the code and see if at all there are issues I can fix :)
